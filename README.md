# DiscordCustomTheme
Custom discord theme for me and my friends.

## How to use
- Close Discord from the tray menu.
Download [this](https://github.com/i3dprogrammer/DiscordCustomTheme/releases/download/v1.0-beta.1/DiscordCustomTheme.zip) and run "Apply Theme.bat" to apply the theme, or run "Remove Theme.bat" to remove the theme, and you're done.
- Launch Discord.
- Write "!bgchange LINK" anywhere to change the background to the direct image link (will reset after restarting & only direct discord/imgur links allowed)
NOTE: works only for Discord v0.0.301

## TODO

- Automatically detect newest discord version.
- ~~Ability to change background image~~
- Ability to change text colors
- ~~Actually upload a ZIP file release.~~
- Persist the !bgchange background command.
