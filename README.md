# DiscordCustomTheme
Custom discord theme for me and my friends.

## How to use
- Close Discord from the tray menu.
- Download [this](https://github.com/i3dprogrammer/DiscordCustomTheme/releases/download/v1.0-beta.2/DiscordCustomTheme.rar) and run "Apply Theme.bat" to apply the theme, or run "Remove Theme.bat" to remove the theme.
- Launch Discord, and you're done.


### How to change background dynamically

- Write "!bgchange LINK" anywhere in discord chat to change the background.

Link Requirements:
- Must be a direct image link
- Must be hosted on cdn.discordapp or imgur.


NOTE: works only for Discord v0.0.301

## TODO

- Automatically detect newest discord version.
- ~~Ability to change background image~~
- Ability to change text colors
- ~~Actually upload a ZIP file release.~~
- Persist the !bgchange background command.
