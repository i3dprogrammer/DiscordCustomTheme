# DiscordCustomTheme
Custom discord theme for me and my friends.

## How to use
Download [this](https://github.com/i3dprogrammer/DiscordCustomTheme/releases/download/v1.0-beta.1/DiscordCustomTheme.zip) and run "Apply Theme.bat" to apply the theme, or run "Remove Theme.bat" to remove the theme, and you're done.

NOTE: works only for Discord v0.0.301

## TODO

- Automatically detect newest discord version.
- Ability to change background image/text colors
- Actually upload a ZIP file release.
