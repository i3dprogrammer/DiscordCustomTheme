# DiscordCustomTheme
Custom discord theme for me and my friends.

## How to use
Copy up everything in ThemeJS.js into Discord's Console (Open up by using Ctrl + Shift + I ) and you're good to go.

NOTE: You have to do this everytime you start up Discord (or just use BetterDiscord)

## Plan to do
1. Instead of copying all the code directly, should make something like this useable.

```javascript
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i3dprogrammer/DiscordCustomTheme/master/ThemeJS.js').then(res => { return res.text() }).then(str => eval(str))
```

2. Make this permanent
